# This is a installer for the command line tool arcanist.
# This installer was ONLY written for mac os x in mind.  Use at your own risk if you choose to try and install
#   this on a linux distro.
#
# Give credit where credit is due -- https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go
# This script was heavily based on the awesome homebrew installer

# This script installs to /usr/local only. To install elsewhere you will have to manually do it yourself!
# --- Manual Install to /usr/local ---
#  mkdir /usr/local/phabricator
#  chmod g+rwx /usr/local/phabricator
#  chgrp admin /usr/local/phabricator
#  cd /usr/local/phabricator
#  git clone https://github.com/facebook/arcanist.git
#  git clone https://github.com/facebook/libphutil.git 
#  ln -s /usr/local/phabricator/arcanist/bin/arc /usr/local/bin/arc

# --- Manual Install to home directory ---
#  mkdir ~/phabricator
#  cd ~/phabricator
#  git clone https://github.com/facebook/arcanist.git
#  git clone https://github.com/facebook/libphutil.git

### Validation functions ###


# Leaving this here even though it should work regardless of version number.
# I have no way to test Mac OS versions before 10.6 to verify, comment out the following line at your own risk.
def current_os? 
  abort "MacOS too old, upgrade to at least 10.6" if macos_version < 10.5 
end

def not_root?
  abort "Don't run this as root!" if Process.uid == 0

def git_installed?
abort <<-EOABORT if `which git`.strip == ""
Git does not appear to be installed on this machine.  Please install it before tyring to install arc.

Installing Git:
  If you have homebrew installed just type
  'brew install git'

  Othwerise use one of the following links
    http://git-scm.com/downloads/
    http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/  
EOABORT
end

def user_admin?
abort <<-EOABORT unless `groups`.split.include? "admin"
This script requires the user #{ENV['USER']} to be an Administrator.  Theoretically you're a developer
installing ARC on your machine so this shouldn't be a problem.  Just make sure you're on the right user account
before re-running the script
EOABORT
end

def arcanist_already_installed?
abort <<-EOABORT if file_exists ARCANIST_INSTALL_LOCATION 
#{ARCANIST_INSTALL_LOCATION} already exists!  Looks like you've already installed this software. 
If you wish to proceed with installation manually delete #{ARCANIST_INSTALL_LOCATION}.

Type 'arc upgrade' to upgrade your current installation instead of reinstalling.
EOABORT
end

def arcanist_already_symlinked?
abort <<-EOABORT if file_exists "/usr/local/bin/arc"
It seem's you already have a piece of software installed called arc in /usr/local/bin.  If this is the case you've
either installed arcanist previously or have a conflicting piece of software installed with the same name.  You
should either uninstall the conflicting arc software or execute a manual install.

Conflict: /usr/local/bin/arc
